Two components:
- tracer: attaches to program, logs lock & other sync variable accesses, and writes it out on exit
- parser: gives you useful data from trace

The tracer currently works pretty well, but the parser is still rudimentary.

Compilation instructions:
- run 'make'

How to use:
1) Run your target program with pthread_trace.so preloaded, as so:
	LD_PRELOAD=$(realpath /path/to/pthread_trace.so) ./my_program --my-args

2) The tracer will generate a dump file named lktracedat-<PID> for every process descended from
the original (incl. the original) that completes normally (i.e. no crashes or external termination). Support for tracing crashed programs is planned in future.

3) Use the lkdump program to examine the results. Currently supports the following commands,
combined with a single dump file as an argument (to the entire program):
	- thread dump (per-thread histories, --threads)
	- object dump (per-sync-object histories, --objects)
	- lock patterns (patterns of lock usage, --patterns)
Multiple of these can be selected on one run of the program. You can also redirect the output
to a file rather than stdout with the -o flag.
